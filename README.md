# Code

OpenTracing needs your help to proliferate. Weâ€™ve already had contributors instrument OSS projects, build tracing systems, and work on the API. If you are interested in getting involved, please drop us a note at [hello@opentracing.com](mailto:hello@opentracing.com) and we will work with you to come up with a useful proposal.

At the moment, the following instrumentations would really help OpenTracing:

- [ ] AWS client libs
- [ ] express
- [x] [Flask](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/python-flask)
- [ ] gRPC:
  - [x] [Go](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-opentracing/tree/master/go/otgrpc) 
  - [x] [Java](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-opentracing/tree/master/java)
  - [ ] Python
  - [ ] Ruby
  - [ ] Objective-C
  - [ ] C++
- [ ] nginx
- [ ] React JS
- [ ] Elasticsearch
- [x] [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/pull/520#issuecomment-249959538)... almost :confused: 
- [ ] MySQL / mariadb
